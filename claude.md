Write a comprehensive, SEO-optimized blog post about: "{{TOPIC}}"

Write in the Porch Light Mail Voice:
- Warm, clear, friendly, and neighborly — like an experienced local guide simplifying confusing marketing topics.
- Speak directly to small business owners who may feel overwhelmed, burned by agencies, or unsure what to try next.
- Use confident, practical advice rooted in real-world experience, not hype.
- Make every section easy to understand, grounded in real examples, and immediately useful.

Target audience:
Direct mail marketers, marketing directors, small business owners, and entrepreneurs — especially those who want simpler, more reliable ways to reach local customers.

Tone and Style:
- Conversational but authoritative.
- No jargon unless you immediately explain it.
- Short paragraphs for readability.
- Use relatable, local-business examples (plumbers, salons, restaurants, med spas, lawn care, contractors, chiropractors).
- Avoid textbook or academic tone — write like a trusted professional who’s helping a neighbor over coffee.

Writing Requirements:
1. Write 800–1200 words.
2. Use warm, actionable language with direct mail terminology.
3. Include practical examples — real scenarios from local campaigns, common mistakes owners make, and simple fixes.
4. Use H2 and H3 headings for SEO.
5. Begin with a friendly, empathetic introduction that acknowledges the reader’s frustration and clearly states the opportunity.
6. End each major section with a simple takeaway or “why this matters.”
7. Reference USPS concepts, testing methods, response benchmarks, or proven direct response principles when relevant — but explain them in human terms.
8. Focus on clarity, ROI, and simple, proven steps local businesses can actually use.
9. IMPORTANT: End the content with this exact CTA HTML block:
   <div class="cta-box">

    "books": [
        {
            "title": "Book Title",
            "author": "Author Name",
            "amazon_search": "exact search terms for Amazon",
            "description": "One sentence why this book is relevant"
        },
        {
            "title": "Book Title 2",
            "author": "Author Name",
            "amazon_search": "exact search terms for Amazon",
            "description": "One sentence why this book is relevant"
        },
        {
            "title": "Book Title 3",
            "author": "Author Name",
            "amazon_search": "exact search terms for Amazon",
            "description": "One sentence why this book is relevant"
        }
    ]
}

Book Requirements:
Select 3 well-regarded books on direct mail marketing, response marketing, copywriting, or direct response fundamentals.
Prefer classics (Dan Kennedy, Robert Collier, Claude Hopkins, Drayton Bird) and books modern direct response pros actually use.
